You will have to manipulate the dataset and use different kind of Python data types that were presented to you during this class. You will also have to use some Python functions or some function that you implemented yourself.\n",

Data is extracted from the Chicago Police Department's CLEAR (Citizen Law Enforcement Analysis and Reporting) system. In order to protect the privacy of crime victims, addresses are shown at block level only and specific locations are not identified. Disclaimer: These crimes may be based upon preliminary information supplied to the Police Department by reporting parties that have not been verified. The preliminary crime classifications may be changed at a later date based upon additional investigation and there is always the possibility of mechanical or human error.\n",
